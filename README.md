In this project, I analyzed Netflix content trends, focusing on country distribution, duration, and key contributors to the platform's content library. This analysis provided insights into genre trends, the dominance of U.S. content, and the most common content durations. The goal was to uncover patterns in Netflix's offerings and provide actionable insights for content strategy.
